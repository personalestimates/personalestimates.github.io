    <h1><div id="wobble">>THE INTERNET IS ABOUT 34 YEARS OLD</div></h1>
    <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 15px;">A brief discussion on the internet and its history from the lens of someone who has used it since they were a child.</p>
    <img src="images/border4.gif">
</div>
    <br>
    <p>It is the year 2024. As I am typing this, I am 23 years old and it‚Äôs about 85 days until my 24th birthday. I am, maybe, about 10 years younger (give or take) than the thing we know as ‚ÄúThe Internet‚Äù.</p>
    <p>It‚Äôs crazy to think that I was born a good decade or so after the internet had been fully established in the 1990s, and also in the year that people thought the computers were going to explode and kill everyone or something along those lines <small>(Y2K Yay!)</small> A fascinating, yet also insane thing to truly experience, really.</p>
    <p>I was born during a time when the Internet and the Web was flourishing <small>(There‚Äôs a key difference between these two things!)</small>, where it was now something <i>everyone</i> was able to enjoy because practically everyone had access to it; whether it be through internet cafes that had computers available for paying customers, the ‚Äòfamily computer that was in the <i>‚Äòcomputerlokaal‚Äô</i> <small>(it was a family member‚Äôs office, but you were allowed to go in there to use the computer)</small>, or simply, the personal computer gifted to them by their family. Everyone was suddenly connected to each other. Everyone was surfing the web because of the internet</p>
    <p>It‚Äôs crazy to think that, had two American IT Engineers named <b>Vint Cerf</b> and <b>Bob Kahn</b> not invented the <b>Transmission Control Protocol</b> <small>(TCP/IP)</small> in 1974, and had‚Äîin 1990‚Äîa British dude named <b>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</b> not been working at an intergovernmental organization known as <b>CERN</b> <small>(The European Organization for Nuclear Research, and in French it‚Äôs apparently <i>Conseil Europ√©en pour la Recherche Nucl√©aire</i>)</small> and hadn‚Äôt decided that it‚Äôd be a neat thing for people to be able to share their information with one another without needing to log into each other‚Äôs computers‚Ä¶ we literally wouldn‚Äôt have both the Internet and the Web, respectively.</p>

    <p>We wouldn‚Äôt have had a means to search for information on questions we wish to have answered, we wouldn‚Äôt have been able to share our thoughts and emotions on social media sites, we wouldn‚Äôt have been able to laugh and cry at stupid videos we find online‚Ä¶</p>
    <p>You literally wouldn‚Äôt have been able to read any of what I had just typed up there.</p>
    <p>That‚Äôs crazy, right? Insane, right?</p>
    <p>Just <b>three</b> people (technically <i>a lot more</i>, but these are the three significant ones at this current time) were all that was needed so that everyone in the whole damn planet was able to browse the web and its strings that connected all of us to each other. So cool‚Ä¶</p>
    <p>So, back to the thing I mentioned about me being born in the year that people thought we were all going to die because our computers were going to kill us or whatever; I basically grew up with the internet and more or less saw how much it had changed over the years. Around the time that I was growing up, I had more or less grown up with the Web and saw it evolve into what we now understand to be the <b>‚ÄúWorld Wide Web‚Äù</b> <small>(We don‚Äôt even use the ‚ÄúWWW.‚Äù anymore)</small>. I‚Äôve seen forums come and die and survive or just be left as a zombie, I‚Äôve seen sites that used to bring joy to kids be shut down for one reason or another, I‚Äôve seen Social Media take over and become the norm that we indulge in on a daily basis. I‚Äôve seen, and experienced, a good chunk of it‚Äînot everything, but a majority.</p>
    <p>I remember the days when there were personal sites, and the way it was encouraged to create your own dedicated little place on the internet‚Äîhow insane these sites looked, how it showed exactly who the person was, and how this was <i>basically</i> their online diary; a look into the person‚Äôs mind. <br>
    I remember when I used to scour for places to play Flash games that were basically just reposted onto these sites without the original creators permission (presumably), but who cares? They were just collecting all of these games into <i>one place</i>. <br>
    I remember the first time I learned about the growing new website called YouTube, where I could suddenly watch AMVs of my favorite Anime and listen to all the music my mom loved to listen to.</p>
    <p>It was a different time, a time where you were exploring and just finding random pages that the still relatively new, lil ol‚Äô Google, was recommending you when you typed something in the search bar.</p>
    <a href="https://www.ncta.com/platform/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/150304_consumer-internet1.jpg" title="The Expanding Consolidation of the Consumer Internet. (2016, April 20). ncta.com." target="_blank"><p>Nowadays, everything is more or less condensed into about 5 or so sites <small>(not horrible, but also not fun anymore)</small>, all with like 5,000 ads all playing at once and you can barely watch a YouTube video without having an ad playing every 5 seconds, and Google doesn‚Äôt even work anymore because they decided that getting paid to bring useless sites to the forefront was better than actually providing correct information, and you <i>need</i> to pay 5 euros per month just to get what you actually want out of a site or any other sort of service on the internet, and then even if you pay you have no say in anything that they do to the site or the service that you are provided.</p></a>
