    <br>
        <p>Finishing up with the discussion on capitalism, let’s now discuss the more emotional aspect of things, which will (hopefully) tie in nicely with the fact that the internet completely “devolved into a giant ad that’s not even good at selling you the stuff you need or want” and also on how people are just… fine with this.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the years went by, and the internet continued to both evolve and aspects of it continued to be passed around by people in power, the desire for capital became the driving force for a lot of large websites/corporations that control said website. This led to ads becoming much more prominent everywhere we look—It should be noted that they already were <i>very</i> prominent, as they showed up as annoying pop-ups or the like. They were there, and still a nuisance that had to be dealt with, however in this modern era it has become much more… intense, yet also subtle, is the best way I can explain it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Let me give an example:<br>
        Have you ever tried watching a YouTube video? You know how before the video starts, a 15 second, or even 30 second ad plays, right? And then maybe… 10 minutes or so in, you’ll have to watch another 30 second ad before you can continue watching. And this goes on, and on, and on for the whole rest of the video. You can’t even skip them, you need to go through the full 30 seconds or else it’s impossible to actually watch the video. So, you do, because it’s a minor inconvenience, right? You’re still able to watch the video, it’s just… there’s an interruption, every 10 minutes or so.    
        </p>
        <p>
        Well, back in the day, there used to be way less ads. You were able to actively just skip through and watch your video, and hell, there was even a time when there weren’t any ads. Yet, I imagine you haven’t really thought much about it right? You just dealt with it, because it's whatever—or, even crazier guess, you’re probably paying for YouTube Premium to avoid getting ads. Okay.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you don’t have this extension, download this on your computer <b><i>right now</i></b>. Don’t worry, the website automatically figures out what browser you’re using, just click on the “Get uBlock Origins” button and add it to your browser. If you’re using Safari, please switch to Firefox, I <b><i>beg</i></b> of you:<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <div id="center">

        </div>
        <img src="images/ublockorigins_screenshot.PNG">
        <p>
        Okay, is it on? Great. Go on YouTube and watch a video now—any video, just anything above 3 minutes or so— and just tell me through this comment section if you saw even one (1) ad pop up during the whole entire video.
        </p>
        <div id="center">
        <iframe src="https://personalestimates.atabook.org" height="500" width="500" frameborder="no" scrolling="yes"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
        Great. Now, keep using this for a couple of days,let’s say about 5 days or so, and then turn off uBlock origins when you’re on YouTube again for at least an hour. You’ll want to turn it back on immediately by at least 30 minutes (or even less) in. Trust me.
        </p>
        <p>
        A completely different experience in the end, right? You’re just able to browse the internet without concerns of ads being bombarded on you and you just get to see the information you want all for free. And you’re now probably asking “why haven’t I done this already?” and the answer to that question is simply: <b><i>you’ve grown complacent</i></b>.
        </p>
        <p>
        What I mean by growing complacent is that over the years, you’ve just grown to accept that the internet is like this now, because they’ve drip-fed you these intense changes for years. It’s a slow process because bombarding you with multitude of ads in one go would have the opposite effect, now because it was a slow build-up to it (switching from pop-ups that were annoying to less invasive ones that are simply on the margins of a page being an example), you would have grown more comfortable with it and saw it as a minor nuisance at best. Put in the fact that there are so many adblockers on the market and you’re now deciding that the best course of action—if you truly are annoyed with the ads—is to either ignore them entirely, or pay for some sort of premium service to block them off because that seems just… easier. Plus, it’s only 5 euros. Can’t be a bad thing.
        </p>
        <p>
        Alongside this, we delve back into the topic of privacy and how this has been taken from us, however a large part to this is also the way that we’ve grown accustomed to seeing people showing their entire lives onto the internet, making it seem as though it is perfectly fine to do so and that the internet is a generally safe place for such a thing. This is present on YouTube with influencers vlogging about their lives, or us average people making a random post on our instagram about something we did or are going through, etc. It’s a means of forming connections with others, however there’s a limit to this that we constantly pass over.
        </p>
        <p>
        A desperation for connection, for understanding, leads to us becoming comfortable putting our deepest darkest secrets on full display on the internet. It should be noted that, although you may think nobody will see your posts, the internet is inhabited daily by about 66% of the world populace. That’s above the margin of “half the world”. That’s 5.35 billion people almost. And there’s that chance that those billions of people would see your vulnerability, and one of the most prominent warnings of the internet is this:
        </p>
        <br>
        <div id="center">
        <p style="font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        <b>The internet is forever.</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        </div>
        <p>
        This complacency we feel to share things isn’t exactly our faults, of course; the world has primarily become dependent on these virtual realities hosted on the internet to connect with others—mostly through social media such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok, or even games that allow us to play together—which leads to us needing to keep others up to date through these online means. This way, all your friends know what you’ve been up to and you don’t need to individually keep people informed. It’s a mindset that has been around since the dawn of Web 1.0! However, the idea of internet safety wasn’t as present until cyber crimes became more prominent overall—especially towards children, the internet’s most vulnerable users. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The necessity to hide your most identifying information was pushed to the forefront for years… until it simply wasn’t anymore. Now everyone knows your full name, your age, your medical records, your entire family line, your BSN, your IBAN, your address—All of this is known because we’ve grown accustomed to sharing things, because we’ve grown to believe that no one will see it, or only those we’ve accepted into our circles will see it, or even just because nobody really told us not to. We’ve become simply complacent and the line between the internet and reality has blurred so much that we genuinely believe ourselves to be safe upon this platform, when in truth… This is not the case.
        </p>
