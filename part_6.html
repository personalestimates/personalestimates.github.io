    <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 15px;">A short observation and discussion on the difference between Web 3.0 and Web3, amongst other things.</p>

    <p>Honestly?</p>
    <p>That's up to you.</p>
    </div>
    <p>I've made it pretty clear already with the foreword that all of this is simply an essay (or blog? Article? Manifesto?) where I explain my own personal views on the internet, how it has changed, and on how I and many other people have begun to try and create something unique and our own that is removed from the confines of capitalism. The point to all of this was simply to inform; provide the resources and just‚Ä¶ Let you figure it out in the end.</p>
    <p>I‚Äôm not going to force you to learn HTML if you aren‚Äôt interested, I‚Äôm not going to radicalize you into this movement and make you into a keyboard warrior against the oppressive Big Tech, I‚Äôm not even really here to have you feel nostalgic for something you may have never experienced (if I did, sorry, I‚Äôm just nostalgic). What I‚Äôm here to do is to just open a door for you and let you decide if you want to go through it or not. It‚Äôs not my choice in the end, it is all yours, as I‚Äôve already made my choice if that isn‚Äôt evident in what you‚Äôve been reading for god knows how long now.</p>
    <p>But, I do hope that this essay at the very least has opened your eyes a little more on the thing we use on a daily basis and somewhat take for granted because we simply have grown so used to this thing that we don‚Äôt even realize just how ingrained in our lives it is, and how we could be experiencing it in a whole new light if we simply‚Ä¶ give it a chance.</p>
    <p>I‚Äôd like to close things off with three things: a thank you from me, a quote from Sir Tim Berners-Lee and two of my favorite manifestos that had been what encouraged me to write this as well as to actually make my websites.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thank you for reading through this and taking the time to consider my words. If I‚Äôve given you any sort of insight, simply let me know through the email below or that comment box 3 pages back.</p>
