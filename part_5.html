    <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 15px;">An introduction to something that could be, and should be.</p>
    <img src="images/border2.gif">
</div>
    <br>
        <p>In a small corner of the internet, known by those that are ingrained in this virtual reality as the <b>peripheral web</b> (the internet outside of the usual main websites we are familiar with), rests an ever growing movement that is presenting the idea of returning back to a simpler time upon the internet; a time where the web was a place of creativity and exploration, of showing yourself, whilst keeping yourself safe. This movement aimed to combine a lot of different aspects of the web to make it a much more fun space again.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>The freedom of customization that was brought forth by Web 1.0</li>
            <li>The accessibility and technological advancements that were introduced by Web 2.0</li>
            <li>And finally the proposal of anonymity and having your privacy controlled by you, and you alone that Web 3.0 was hoping for.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>With all of these combined, the aptly titled the <b><i>‚ÄúWeb Revival Movement‚Äù</i></b> was born.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        It is not entirely clear when this movement began, but the most noted beginning to the movement was in February 2021 when a <b>Discord</b> (popular community chatting program) server was created as a starting point for this community and organization referred to as <b>Yesterweb</b>. Their main goals were presented through a long manifesto explaining that their goal is to create a unified internet that is inclusive and open for personal-growths through selflessness. Of course, this a very simplified version of their message, which wasn‚Äôt even entirely based on the internet itself, but based around our interactions with one another on the internet, but their core commitments as they call them show clearly what they were aiming for:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>The commitment to social responsibility and partisanship</b></li>
            <li><b>The commitment to collective well-being and personal growth</b></li>
            <li><b>The commitment to rehumanizing social relations and reversing the process of social alienation</b></li>
        </ol>
    <br>
    <p>
    To most outside of the peripheral web these tenets would feel more like lofty goals, the group were able to actually create a large community that became a <b>webring</b> (A collection of sites that all link to each other in some way), collections of community made zines, different servers on websites not connected to the <b>core web</b> (Opposite of peripheral web; where most people usually hang out), and even a forum! A big thing about the Yesterweb movement was also that they were the ones to spearhead an anti-web3 campaign back in November 2021, which was also how a lot of people from the core web began to be interested in the peripheral web and what Yesterweb was proposing overall. Though, in 2023, they would go on an indefinite hiatus due to the community growing too large for their small staff to be able to handle at this current time.
    </p>
    <p>However, their server was where the term ‚ÄúWeb Revival‚Äù was actually coined and began to encompass that community that was built back in 2021 as they needed something to refer to what we know as the ‚Äúwider web crafting community‚Äù that didn‚Äôt just dump every person that made a personal website into this community, since there were still people who simply made a website because they wanted to, and not to join into this movement. Most of these communities also began to migrate from the known websites such as Twitter, Instagram, etc. and move to websites such as BlueSky, Mastodon, etc. because of them providing the functionality that they desire, whilst also being primarily open sourced and contributed by the people and not just one large corporation.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that multiple different people all have their own interpretations of what Web Revival should encompass altogether, but a major thing that I‚Äôve noted from all of these places are these few common traits as presented by Melon of Melonland:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Creativity is First</b> - Most see the ability to design, decorate and graffiti digital spaces as essential and powerful</li>
        <li><b>The Internet is Fun</b> - Most want the Web to be a playground that's free to explore and enjoy</li>
        <li><b>Corporations are Boring</b> - Most are sick of the monetisation, data abuse and endless breaches of trust in corporate culture</li>
        <li><b>The Web is Friendly</b> - All feel that the Web should be friendly and supportive; caring is a radical act</li>
        <li><b>Right to Repair</b> - They value the freedom to make, break and repair their stuff - tinkering is a form of debate and protest</li>
        <li><b>One World Wide Web</b> - They want free open knowledge and global connectivity, without paywalls, bubbles or borders</li>
        <li><b>Chaotic Effort</b> - They believe that value comes from time and effort put into projects they love for no reason other than love</li>
        <li><b>No to Web3</b> - To most, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, unfairly trained AIs and buzzword tech are unwelcome and uncool</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So why all the information about this small (but large!) community? Because it‚Äôs good to know about all the different aspects of the internet, from the good to the bad to the meh, and to also learn new things to expand your own personal archive of skills and information; Nowadays youths and even adults aren‚Äôt being taught how to code a website, much less how to really use a computer, as we‚Äôve moved from computers to tablets and smartphones due to them being more convenient for us to utilize, however learning to code‚Äîor learning about how to actually make your own website that you can manage on your own‚Äîis important even if you aren‚Äôt interested in the movement. And you‚Äôre probably asking right now ‚Äú<i>But how do I even do that?!</i>‚Äù and answering that question is super easy for me, because I‚Äôm actually gonna show you.</p>
    <p>There are many ways to actually make your own website and it doesn‚Äôt even need to be super fancy to begin with. All you need is a program such as Notepad, basic HTML knowledge, and the time and patience to learn and grow. It feels daunting, but trust me; the more you do it, the easier it gets.</p>
    <p>So we‚Äôll start with at least showing you some parts of how this website was built: a website begins with the skeleton, which is always going to be:
    </p>
    <pre>
    &#x3C;!DOCTYPE html&#x3E;
    &#x3C;html&#x3E;
    &#x3C;/html&#x3E;
    </pre>
    <p>This is to help the internet read and understand what must be shown on screen.</p>
    <p>It is then followed by adding the head, so that we may title the website, and make it possible to configure it for accessibility purposes! This is done like so:
    </p>
    <pre>
    &#x3C;!DOCTYPE html&#x3E;
    &#x3C;html&#x3E;
    &#x3C;head&#x3E;
    &#x3C;title&#x3E;&#x1F436; WEB REVIVAL&#x3C;/title&#x3E;
    &#x3C;/head&#x3E;
    &#x3C;body&#x3E;
    &#x3C;p&#x3E; Hello world, I love dogs&#x1F436;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
    &#x3C;/html&#x3E;
    </pre>
    <p>And finally, we will add the <code>&#x3C;body&#x3E;</code> after <code>&#x3C;/head&#x3E;</code>, and in there we‚Äôll put all the information we‚Äôd like in a <code>&#x3C;p&#x3E;</code> (Paragraph) element.</p>
    <pre>
    &#x3C;!DOCTYPE html&#x3E;
    &#x3C;html&#x3E;
    &#x3C;head&#x3E;
    &#x3C;title&#x3E;&#x1F436; WEB REVIVAL&#x3C;/title&#x3E;
    &#x3C;/head&#x3E;
    &#x3C;body&#x3E;
    &#x3C;p&#x3E; Hello world, I love dogs&#x1F436;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
    &#x3C;/body&#x3E;
    &#x3C;/html&#x3E;
    </pre>
    <p>Now, save this file as <b>mysite.html</b> or something, but it <strong>NEEDS</strong> to have .html at the end for this to work! Go look for it in your files and then double click it to let it open on your browser. And ta-da! You just made your first website ever!
    </p>
    <p>But it still feels like a lot, doesn‚Äôt it? I promise you, though, it‚Äôs not a difficult thing to learn. There are hundreds of resources available to teach you the basics of HTML and then to learn the basics of CSS and then to go further, and further, and further until you‚Äôre a coding master. Until you yourself are one of those webmasters from back in the day who were literally doing magic through this magical thing called code. And you aren‚Äôt alone in this journey! There‚Äôs hundreds of other people also joining you and there are sites that have people more than willing to put some time to answer your question and help you to fix your code with you. Because they know the struggle, they know that it can be difficult, so we have to help each other every step of the way.
    </p>
    <p>We all can be webmasters, and we all can create something unique to ourselves if we simply put our minds and our passions into it.
    </p>
    <p>That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm providing here some of the resources I had personally utilized to learn how to code and to create both this website and also my very first <a href="https://thisdog.neocities.org">‚Äúweb art‚Äù</a></p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML" target="_blank">Developer Mozilla</a> ‚Äì Teaches you everything you‚Äôd need to know about HTML! There are also more guides that they present, but it‚Äôs good to start with HTML.

    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Programs I recommend for actually building your site:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://brackets.io" target="_blank">Brackets</a> ‚Äì A small-scale program that is available for both Windows and Mac! Super simple and this was made for website building! You can add extensions to make your life even easier with it.
